<p><b><a href="/wiki/main">Inky</a></b> is an <a href="/wiki/open_source">open source</a> / free wiki engine. It is undergoing current early stage development.</p> <br><br><h3>History</h3><hr> <br><p><b>Inky</b> was developed by <a href="/wiki/Brian_Evans">Brian Evans</a> in early/mid 2017. At that time it was called <b>ColorWiki</b>. It was developed using the <a href="/wiki/python_(programming_language)">Python</a> <a href="/wiki/programming_language">programming language</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Bottle">Bottle</a> (a web framework for Python). It also utilizes <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>, and a flexible templating system provided by Bottle.</p> <p>Taking inspiration from <a href="/wiki/MonkeyWiki">MonkeyWiki</a> by <a href="/wiki/Barnaby_Scott">Barnaby Scott</a>, <a href="/wiki/main">Inky</a> is an attempt to improve upon other lightweight wiki implementations with easy scripting and a clean styled look. New page creation is done by typing in what you are looking for. The system would not be strongly linked, ala MonkeyWiki, and would instead allow for content islands (pages with no links to them).</p> <p>The type system developed for <b><a href="/wiki/main">Inky</a></b> resembles and is based on <a href="/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, but is limited to the abilities necessary for editing a wiki page. Present limitations include an inability to create links to outside resources and a lack of image or file upload. All of those are in the works, as well as toggles for different visual modes.</p> <br><br><h3>Reasoning</h3><hr><br><p>There are a number of Wiki engines available to those who want to look for them (far more than will ever be needed or used). <b><a href="/wiki/main">Inky</a></b> is mostly being used to develop further software development skills. However, it is a highly usable system. It operates without a database, is easy to set up, and is lightweight. This makes it perfect for its target platform: <A href="/wiki/Pirate_Box">Pirate Box</a>. It allows for the quick creation of pages, as well as editing those pages, renaming them, and deleting them. An admin config panel is forthcoming. It will allow for the admin to customize the setup of the page and a number of environment variables with no coding knowledge necessary.</p><br><br><h3>Contact</h3><hr> <br><p>Please direct any inquiries to <a href="/wiki/Brian_Evans">Brian Evans</a>.

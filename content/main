<p>Welcome to <b>Inky</b>! Inky is a lightweight <a href="/wiki/python_(programming_language)">Python</a> based wiki engine. It uses the <a href="/wiki/Bottle_(Python_framework)">Bottle</a> micro-framework. Inky is targeted at the <A href="/wiki/Pirate_Box">Pirate Box</a> / Library Box computing systems as an easy to install article system for anonymous users.</p><br /><br /><h3>Creating Articles</h3><hr /><br><p>There are two basic methods to create a new article: <br /><br /><ul><li>Search for a page in the search bar in the top section of each page. If the page does not yet exist, you will be invited to create it. If it exists already, the page will be loaded.</li><li>The other way to create a new article is to follow a link to an article that has not been created yet. There are many links found throughout a wiki. When you find or create (and follow) one that does not exist, you will be prompted to enter the data for that article.</li></ul></p><br /><br /><h3>Editing Articles</h3><hr /><br><p>All articles, with the exception of this one and the <a href="/wiki/about">about</a> article, can be edited. They can also be renamed or deleted. When you visit an article (again, other than this page and the <a href="/wiki/about">about</a> article) you will see the edit, rename, and delete options in the top right just under the search bar.</p> When editing an article you can enhance the text by using <b><a href="/wiki/Inky_Markup">Inky Markup</a></b>.</p><p>When possible, try to keep text between paragraph markers and avoid entering newlines into the editor. While new lines/carriage returns are supported, they are not a preferred way to sculpt an article and may become deprecated in the future via the automatic removal of newlines that are not controlled by <a href="/wiki/Inky_Markup">Inky Markup</a>.</p>

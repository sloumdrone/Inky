<p>Welcome to <b>MyWiki</b>! This introductory article exists to teach you the basics of editing and article creation. All articles have three buttons at the bottom right of the page: Edit, Rename, and Delete. All of them do exactly what you would think they would do. The exception to the rule is that while they appear, they cannot beused on the pages <a href="/wiki/main">main</a> and <a href="/wiki/about">about</a>.</p>
<br /><br /><h3>Creating Articles</h3><hr /><p>There are two basic methods to create a new article: <br /><br /><b>1)</b> Go to the URL bar of your <a href="/wiki/web_browser"> web browser</a> and change <i>/wiki/main</i> (which should be there now) to <i>/wiki/<b>youpagename</b></i>, where youpagename is whatever you want the new article to be called. Keep in mind that spaces do not work. Use an underscore or a dash.<br /><br /><b>2)</b> The other way to create a new article is to follow a link to an article that has not been created yet. There are many links found throughout a wiki. Some of them lead to articles that exist. Some of them do not. When you find one that does not exist, you will be prompted to enter the data for that article.</p><br /><br /><h3>Editing Articles</h3><hr /><p>When editing an article you can create enhance the text by using <b>WikiMarkup</b>. This consists of the characters: <b>[x:</b>, an opening bracket followed by a letter followed by a colon followed by a space (to open a tag). To close a tag the pattern is reversed: <b>:x]</b> (a space, a colon, a letter, and a closing bracket). In both examples, <b>x</b> would be replaced by the letter for the markup you are wanting to create.</p> <p><a href="/wiki/Links">Links</a> are created using a capital <b>F</b> with the name of the page you want to link to in between. Page names can include spaces, but cannot include symbols. You can even link to pages that do not yet exist. When a user  clicks that link they will be offered the opportunity to create the page, if they would like.</p> <p>The currently supported tags are as follows:</p> <p><blockquote><ul><li>b - bold</li><li>i - italics</li><li>F - internal wiki link</li><li>s - subscript</li><li>S - superscript</li><li>q - block quote</li><li>p - paragraph</li><li>h - header row</li><li>L - create a list (this should surround all the list items and list item tags)</li><li>l - list item</li><li>n - new line</li></ul></blockquote></p> <p>When possible, try to keep text between paragraph markers and avoid entering newlines into the editor, they are supported, but not a preferred way to build and may become deprecated in the future via the automatic removal of newlines that are not controled by script/wikiCode.</p>

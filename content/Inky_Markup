<p>When editing an article you can enhance the text by using <b>InkyMarkup</b>. This consists of the characters: <b>[x:</b>, an opening bracket followed by a letter followed by a colon followed by a space (to open a tag). To close a tag the pattern is reversed: <b>:x]</b> (a space, a colon, a letter, and a closing bracket). In both examples, <b>x</b> would be replaced by the letter for the markup you are wanting to create.</p> <p><a href="/wiki/Links">Links</a> are created using a capital <b>F</b> with the name of the page you want to link to in between. Page names can include spaces, but cannot include symbols. You can even link to pages that do not yet exist. When a user clicks that link they will be offered the opportunity to create the page, if they would like.</p> <p>The currently supported tags are as follows:</p> <p><blockquote><ul><li>b - bold</li><li>i - italics</li><li>F - internal wiki link</li><li>s - sub script</li><li>S - super script</li><li>q - block quote</li><li>p - paragraph</li><li>h - header row</li><li>L - create a list (this should surround all the list items and list item tags)</li><li>l - list item</li><li>n - new line</li></ul></blockquote></p> <p>When possible, try to keep text between paragraph markers and avoid entering newlines into the editor, they are supported, but not a preferred way to build and may become deprecated in the future via the automatic removal of newlines that are not controled by script/wikiCode.</p>
